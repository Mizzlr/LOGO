# Turtle-Graphics-LOGO-Lang-Compiler

Python has this module called [turtle](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html).
[LOGO](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Logo_(programming_language) is a programming language, to draw with turtle graphics.))))))
This repo implements a [compiler](logo/compiler) and [runtime](logo/runtime) for LOGO language using python and its turtle module.

The syntax may not be completely compatible with the original, as I have added certain features while removed certain original features. This is just a fun project for the Turtle Graphics with [REPL](logo/runtime/repl.py) for the UI.e)eauaoeu)
